# Dashboard C++

My first C++ dashboard application - A learning project exploring Windows GUI development.

## About

This project was created as an introduction to C++ development on Windows. It demonstrates basic concepts of:

- Windows console applications
- C++ fundamentals
- Compilation with Visual Studio

## Files

```
├── slash.cpp       # Main source code
├── compile.bat     # Batch script to compile
├── slash 1.0.exe   # Compiled executable
└── .vscode/        # VS Code configuration
```

## Requirements

- Windows OS
- Visual Studio or MinGW compiler
- C++11 or later

## Compilation

### Using batch script
```batch
compile.bat
```

### Manual compilation
```batch

```

## Usage

```batch
# Run the executable
slash 1.0.exe
```

## Learning Goals

- [x] Basic C++ syntax
- [x] Console I/O
- [x] Windows executable creation
- [ ] GUI frameworks (future)
